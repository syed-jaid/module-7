            <p>Although C# is derived from the C programming language, it introduces some unique and powerful features,
                such
                as delegates (which can be viewed as type-safe function pointers) and lambda expressions which introduce
                elements of functional programming languages, as well as a simpler single class inheritance model (than
                C++)
                and, for those of you with experience in "C-like" languages, a very familiar syntax that may help
                beginners
                become proficient faster than its predecessors. Similar to Java, it is object-oriented, comes with an
                extensive class library, and supports exception handling, multiple types of polymorphism, and separation
                of
                interfaces from implementations. </p>
